When deploying multiple Socket.IO servers, there are two things to take care of:

- enabling sticky session, if HTTP long-polling is enabled (which is the default): see [below](#Enabling-sticky-session)
- using the Redis adapter (or another compatible [Adapter](/docs/v3/glossary/#Adapter)): see [below](#Passing-events-between-nodes)

## Sticky load balancing

If you plan to distribute the load of connections among different processes or machines, you have to make sure that all requests associated with a particular session ID reach the process that originated them.

### Why is sticky-session required

This is because the HTTP long-polling transport sends multiple HTTP requests during the lifetime of the Socket.IO session.

In fact, Socket.IO could technically work without sticky sessions, with the following synchronization (in dashed lines):

![Using multiple nodes without sticky sessions](/images/mutiple-nodes-no-sticky.png)

While obviously possible to implement, we think that this synchronization process between the Socket.IO servers would result in a big performance hit for your application.

Remarks:

- without enabling sticky-session, you will experience HTTP 400 errors due to "Session ID unknown"
- the WebSocket transport does not have this limitation, since it relies on a single TCP connection for the whole session. Which means that if you disable the HTTP long-polling transport (which is a perfectly valid choice in 2021), you won't need sticky sessions:

```js
const socket = io("https://io.yourhost.com", {
  // WARNING: in that case, there is no fallback to long-polling
  transports: [ "websocket" ] // or [ "websocket", "polling" ] (the order matters)
});
```

Documentation: [`transports`](/docs/v3/client-initialization/#transports)

### Enabling sticky-session

To achieve sticky-session, there are two main solutions:

- routing clients based on a cookie (recommended solution)
- routing clients based on their originating address

You will find below some examples with common load-balancing solutions:

- [NginX](#NginX-configuration) (IP-based)
- [Apache HTTPD](#Apache-HTTPD-configuration) (cookie-based)
- [HAProxy](#HAProxy-configuration) (cookie-based)
- [Traefik](#Traefik) (cookie-based)
- [Node.js `cluster` module](#Using-Node-js-Cluster)

For other platforms, please refer to the relevant documentation:

- Kubernetes: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/affinity/cookie/
- AWS (Application Load Balancers): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html#sticky-sessions
- GCP: https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#session_affinity
- Heroku: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/session-affinity

**Important note**: if you are in a CORS situation (the front domain is different from the server domain) and session affinity is achieved with a cookie, you need to allow credentials:

*Server*

```js
const io = require("socket.io")(httpServer, {
  cors: {
    origin: "https://front-domain.com",
    methods: ["GET", "POST"],
    credentials: true
  }
});
```

*Client*

```js
const io = require("socket.io-client");
const socket = io("https://server-domain.com", {
  withCredentials: true
});
```

Without it, the cookie will not be sent by the browser and you will experience HTTP 400 "Session ID unknown" responses. More information [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials).

### NginX configuration

Within the `http { }` section of your `nginx.conf` file, you can declare a `upstream` section with a list of Socket.IO process you want to balance load between:

```nginx
http {
  server {
    listen 3000;
    server_name io.yourhost.com;

    location / {
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;

      proxy_pass http://nodes;

      # enable WebSockets
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
  }

  upstream nodes {
    # enable sticky session with either "hash" (uses the complete IP address)
    hash $remote_addr consistent;
    # or "ip_hash" (uses the first three octets of the client IPv4 address, or the entire IPv6 address)
    # ip_hash;
    # or "sticky" (needs commercial subscription)
    # sticky cookie srv_id expires=1h domain=.example.com path=/;

    server app01:3000;
    server app02:3000;
    server app03:3000;
  }
}
```

Notice the `hash` instruction that indicates the connections will be sticky.

Make sure you also configure `worker_processes` in the topmost level to indicate how many workers NginX should use. You might also want to look into tweaking the `worker_connections` setting within the `events { }` block.

### Apache HTTPD configuration

```apache
Header add Set-Cookie "SERVERID=sticky.%{BALANCER_WORKER_ROUTE}e; path=/" env=BALANCER_ROUTE_CHANGED

<Proxy "balancer://nodes_polling">
    BalancerMember "http://app01:3000" route=app01
    BalancerMember "http://app02:3000" route=app02
    BalancerMember "http://app03:3000" route=app03
    ProxySet stickysession=SERVERID
</Proxy>

<Proxy "balancer://nodes_ws">
    BalancerMember "ws://app01:3000" route=app01
    BalancerMember "ws://app02:3000" route=app02
    BalancerMember "ws://app03:3000" route=app03
    ProxySet stickysession=SERVERID
</Proxy>

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} =websocket [NC]
RewriteRule /(.*) balancer://nodes_ws/$1 [P,L]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} !=websocket [NC]
RewriteRule /(.*) balancer://nodes_polling/$1 [P,L]

ProxyTimeout 3

### Traefik

Using container labels:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:2.4
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    links:
      - server

  server:
    image: my-image:latest
    labels:
      - "traefik.http.routers.my-service.rule=PathPrefix(`/`)"
      - traefik.http.services.my-service.loadBalancer.sticky.cookie.name=server_id
      - traefik.http.services.my-service.loadBalancer.sticky.cookie.httpOnly=true
```

With the [File provider](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v2.0/providers/file/):

```yaml
## Dynamic configuration
http:
  services:
    my-service:
      rule: "PathPrefix(`/`)"
      loadBalancer:
        sticky:
          cookie:
            name: server_id
            httpOnly: true
```

### Using Node.js Cluster

Just like NginX, Node.js comes with built-in clustering support through the `cluster` module.

There are several solutions, depending on your use case:

| NPM package | How it works |
|:------:| ------------ |
| [`@socket.io/sticky`](https://github.com/darrachequesne/socket.io-sticky) | the routing is based on the `sid` query parameter |
| [`sticky-session`](https://github.com/indutny/sticky-session) | the routing is based on `connection.remoteAddress` |
| [`socketio-sticky-session`](https://github.com/wzrdtales/socket-io-sticky-session) | the routing based on the `x-forwarded-for` header) |

Example with `@socket.io/sticky`:

```js
const cluster = require("cluster");
const http = require("http");
const { Server } = require("socket.io");
const redisAdapter = require("socket.io-redis");
const numCPUs = require("os").cpus().length;
const { setupMaster, setupWorker } = require("@socket.io/sticky");

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);

  const httpServer = http.createServer();
  setupMaster(httpServer, {
    loadBalancingMethod: "least-connection", // either "random", "round-robin" or "least-connection"
  });
  httpServer.listen(3000);

  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on("exit", (worker) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
    cluster.fork();
  });
} else {
  console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);

  const httpServer = http.createServer();
  const io = new Server(httpServer);
  io.adapter(redisAdapter({ host: "localhost", port: 6379 }));
  setupWorker(io);

  io.on("connection", (socket) => {
    /* ... */
  });
}
```

## Passing events between nodes

### The Redis adapter

Now that you have multiple Socket.IO nodes accepting connections, if you want to broadcast events to all clients (or to the clients in a certain [room](/docs/v3/rooms/)) you&#8217;ll need some way of passing messages between processes or computers.

The interface in charge of routing messages is what we call the [Adapter](/docs/v3/glossary/#Adapter). You can implement your own on top of the [socket.io-adapter](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-adapter) (by inheriting from it) or you can use the one we provide on top of [Redis](https://redis.io/): [socket.io-redis](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-redis):

```js
const io = require("socket.io")(3000);
const redis = require("socket.io-redis");
io.adapter(redis({ host: "localhost", port: 6379 }));
```

Then the following call:

```js
io.emit("hi", "all sockets");
```

will be broadcast to every clients through the [Pub/Sub mechanism](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub) of Redis:

![Broadcasting with Redis](/images/broadcasting-redis.png)

### Sending messages from the outside world

Using the Redis adapter has another benefit: you can now emit events from outside the context of your Socket.IO processes.

![Diagram with Redis adapter and external emitter](/images/redis-emitter.png)

This emitter is available in several languages:

- Javascript: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-emitter
- Java: https://github.com/sunsus/socket.io-java-emitter
- Python: https://pypi.org/project/socket.io-emitter/
- PHP: https://github.com/rase-/socket.io-php-emitter
- Golang: https://github.com/yosuke-furukawa/socket.io-go-emitter
