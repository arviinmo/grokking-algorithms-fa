Hi everyone!

Here's the #2 edition of our Monthly update. This is a new experiment, we will try to stick to this frequency in order to keep you updated of the work in progress and the directions the project is taking.

<!--truncate-->

So, what's new in the Socket.IO ecosystem?

## Socket.IO v3

As announced in the [previous](/blog/monthly-update-2/) monthly update, Socket.IO v3 has been released a few days ago.

This major version bump is mandated by several necessary changes in the Engine.IO protocol. You can find more information about these changes in the [Engine.IO v4 release notes](/blog/engine-io-4-release/).

You can find the release notes [here](/blog/socket-io-3-release/) and the migration guide [here](/docs/v3/migrating-from-2-x-to-3-0/).

Let's discuss about this release here: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/discussions/3674

## Redis Adapter v6

Following the [release of Socket.IO v3.0.0](/blog/socket-io-3-release/), the Redis Adapter was updated and a new release is out: [6.0.0](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-redis/releases/tag/6.0.0)

You can find the release notes [here](/blog/socket-io-redis-adapter-6-release/).

## Documentation

The documentation has always been a weak point of the project, leading to a lot of issues opened on GitHub and questions on StackOverflow.

Now that v3 is out, we will focus on this. The following pages have already been created:

- [Emitting events](/docs/v3/emitting-events/)
- [Broadcasting events](/docs/v3/broadcasting-events/)
- [The Socket instance / server-side](/docs/v3/server-socket-instance/)
- [Middlewares](/docs/v3/middlewares/)
- [Handling CORS](/docs/v3/handling-cors/)

If you find a typo, please open an issue here: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-website
